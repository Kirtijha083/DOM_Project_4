# 📋 DOM Practice Project

# 🚀 Overview

This project showcases advanced *DOM manipulation* techniques using *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript*. It features a smooth and interactive image hover animation that enhances user engagement. The animation ensures that images dynamically follow the cursor movement while staying confined within their respective div containers. By leveraging *getBoundingClientRect()*, the cursor's position is accurately calculated, ensuring precise and seamless movement within each section.
